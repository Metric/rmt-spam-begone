# rmt-spam-begone
RMT Spam Begone is a simple heuristic based RMT spam detection algorithm

I have been working on this filter for many years. Incorporating things I have seen over the years in various game chats.

The primary goal behind releasing this as MIT is to ensure other developers have access to it and will add it to their game / chat servers. Looking at you various big AAA Online Multiplayer Games with Chats; that say it so hard to prevent this sort of spam due to varying changes in the text. So, I hope you take this and add it to your systems in some fashion as a micro service or something.

If you wish to help improve this further, then please add a pull request so all developers can benefit from it.
